WIP Writeup:


Each of us have completed the barebones implementation of the individual visualizations that we have assigned to ourselves. The screenshots of the current progress are included below. This includes a bar chart, a world map visualization, and fire chart ready to be animated. We are behind schedule, as we have yet to begin working on the transitions and still need to aggregate our individual project files. After finishing the details of each visualization, the next step will be to implement the direct interactions, integrate the project, and finalize the views. 

Due to feedback on our proposal, we realized we may accidentally have assigned the same data to be represented in two different charts. Because of this, we have modified which dataset is to be used for which visualization. The bar chart will use temperature by major city, while the flame animated chart will use general global temperatures dataset and perform a multiyear depiction/average.
