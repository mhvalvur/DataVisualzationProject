WIP Writeup:
In addition to the project, document your current project status in a readme.md file using markdown. This readme should be in the root directory of the git repository and included in the version.

Briefly describe the features that are finished and the features that need to be completed.
Briefly talk about any changes in the project since the proposal. Such as, have any designs or interactions changed?
Add at least 1 screenshot documenting your current prototype running. This screenshot should include all the visualizations implemented so far (you can use multiple screenshots if necessary).
Add a link to the original data source, and if the data was pre-processed, describe what you did.


Each of us have completed the barebones implementation of the individual visualizations that we have assigned to ourselves. The screenshots of the current progress are included below.

Due to feedback on our proposal, we realized we may accidentally have assigned the same data to be represented in two different charts. Because of this, we have modified which dataset is to be used for which visualization. The bar chart will use temperature by major city, while the flame animated chart will use general global temperatures dataset and perform a multiyear depiction/average.
